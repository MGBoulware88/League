This is a simple python app that asks the user 3questions:
-how much LP do you gain (when you win)
-how much LP do you lose (when you lose)
-how much LP do you need to hit you rank goal?

 It then prints out how many games they will need to play over 55/60/65/70% winrates to hit their goal.

 If the goal isn't attainable at a certain winrate, it will instead say that winrate is not high enough.
